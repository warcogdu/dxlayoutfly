Design DevX layouts on the fly while bound to data. Fast & easy way to create report & grid layouts in a runtime environment **without having to switch between design & run mode** or add un-necessary datasets/adapters/connections to your forms just to design in a bound environment.

This tool is designed to be used by .Net developers who use (& have a valid license for) [DevExpress](http://www.devexpress.com) XtraGird & XtraReports.

See [Here](WhatsAFlyLayout.md) for more info about how [Fly Layouts](WhatsAFlyLayout.md) are saved.


**NOTE:** _This project is in no way assiciated with DevExpress nor do we publish or provide any of the DevExpress code or controls. This is just a small utility to help generate xml layouts on the fly with a bit of data binding._
